How can I help ?
----------------

One easy way to help is to `write a description`_ for your favorite config
file; you don't need to be a developer to do that.

If you want to roll up your sleeves and help, the Todo_ list has some items
that desparately need somebody to look at, including some items that only
take a few minutes but would be enormously useful to us to make sure Augeas
correctly processes as many files as possible.

Where is the mailing list ?
---------------------------

The mailing list is ``augeas-devel@redhat.com``. Subscribe by going to `the
list page`_.

The list is for any discussion around Augeas, be it bug reports, feature
requests, trouble writing file format descriptions etc.

Where is the IRC channel ?
--------------------------

The best place to find somebody connected to Augeas on IRC is ``#augeas``
on Freenode_. Use the following settings in your IRC client:

* Server: ``chat.freenode.net``
* Port: ``6667`` (the default IRC port)
* Channel: ``#augeas``

Where is the Bugtracker ?
-------------------------

Bugs are kept in a `Trac instance`_ on fedorahosted.org. You need to have
an account in the `Fedora Account System`_ to log into it.

Where is the source ?
---------------------

Sources are in a `git repository`_. To check out the code, run

::

  git clone git://git.fedorahosted.org/augeas.git

There is a `second public repository`_ on github, just as up-to-date as the
one above. If you want to follow repository changes, you can use github's
"Watch" feature on that repository.

.. _second public repository: http://github.com/lutter/augeas

To build and explore, you need to:

::

  cd augeas
  ./autogen.sh && make
  # Start a session with augtool that reads lens descriptions from ./lenses
  # and runs with AUGEAS_ROOT=./build/try, populated from ./tests/root/
  ./src/try cli

Besides autotools_ (in particular, ``autoconf``, ``automake``, and
``libtool``), you will need to have ``readline-devel``, Bison_ and Flex_
installed to build Augeas successfully.

What language bindings are available ?
