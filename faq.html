<h2>Basic Questions</h2>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>What license is Augeas ditributed under ?</dt>
<dd>Augeas is distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html">LGPL</a>)
A copy of the license is included in the file <tt class="docutils literal">COPYING</tt> in the source
distribution.</dd>
<dt>Can I use Augeas from a proprietary application ?</dt>
<dd>Yes. The LGPL allows you to use Augeas from a proprietary application. It
would be very helpful to both you and the community if you send bug fixes
and improvements as patches for possible incorporation in the main
development tree. It will decrease your maintenance costs anyway if you
do so.</dd>
<dt>How do I get Augeas ?</dt>
<dd>The <a class="reference external" href="download.html">download</a> page explains where you can find released RPM's and
tarballs and how you can check the latest development version out from
Mercurial</dd>
<dt>What's with that name ?</dt>
<dd>To quote <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augeas">Wikipedia</a>: &quot;<em>In Greek mythology, Augeas ... was King of Elis ... He is best known ... for his stables, which housed the single greatest number of cattle in the country and had never been cleaned.</em>&quot;</dd>
<dt>How do I contribute to Augeas ?</dt>
<dd>The main means of communication is the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/augeas-devel">Augeas mailing list</a>
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">augeas-devel&#64;redhat.com</span></tt>. For more information on contributing, see
<a class="reference external" href="developers.html">the contribute page</a></dd>
<dt>I don't know any C — can I still help ?</dt>
<dd>Of course. Besides writing code, there are <a class="reference external" href="developers.html">many more areas</a> where Augeas
needs help: evaluating existing tree representations of configuration
files, writing descriptions for new file formats, and documenting Augeas'
tree structure are all areas where help is sorely needed.</dd>
<dt>Can I use Augeas for other text files ?</dt>
<dd>Yes, there is actually nothing specific to configuration files in
Augeas. If you have some other unstructured text file that you'd like to
transform into a tree, all you need to do is write a file format
description for it.</dd>
<dt>Can I change a file with Augeas and still edit it by other means ?</dt>
<dd>Yes. One of the main design goals of Augeas is to not interfere with any
other ways in which you might change your configuration files. Augeas
works very hard to preserve comments and formatting details such as the
number of spaces used to separate fields etc. It also does not depend on
any additional information embedded in comments — you can always
alternate between changing a configuration file with your favorite editor
or custom script, and changing it with Augeas.</dd>

<div class="section" id="using-augeas">
<h2>Using Augeas</h2>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Can I use Augeas in a shell script ?</dt>
<dd>Yes, the <tt class="docutils literal">augtool</tt> command can be used to manipulate the tree and the
underlying files with shell scripts. Run <tt class="docutils literal">augtool help</tt> for a list of
commands <tt class="docutils literal">augtool</tt> supports.</dd>
<dt>What language bindings are available ?</dt>
<dd>Bindings for Ruby, Python, OCaml, Perl, Haskell, PHP, Lua, and Java are
available for <a class="reference external" href="download.html">download</a>. Patches/additions for other languages are eagerly
anticipated.</dd>
<dt>Do I need to know how file formats are described ?</dt>
<dd>No, that is only necessary if you want to change how files are mapped
into the tree or map new files. For using Augeas, it is enough to
understand the functionality provided by <tt class="docutils literal">augtool</tt>, or the equivalent
calls in C or the language bindings.</dd>
<dt>How is the Augeas tree structured ?</dt>
<dd>Each node in the Augeas tree consists of three pieces of data: a <em>label</em>
and a <em>value</em>, both strings, and a list of <em>child</em> nodes. The label and
value are both strings. The label is used in the path to the node and
child nodes, much as file names are used in the paths to files in a file
system. The label must not contain the characters <tt class="docutils literal">/</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">*</tt> or end
with <tt class="docutils literal">[N]</tt> where N is a positive number.</dd>
<dt>Can a node have multiple children with the same label ?</dt>
<dd>Yes, that is the biggest difference between the Augeas tree and files in
a filesystem (and makes it similar to DOM's for XML documents). A node
can have any number of children called <tt class="docutils literal">foo</tt>; in paths, a specific
child can be picked out with <tt class="docutils literal">foo[N]</tt> where <tt class="docutils literal">N</tt> is a positive number
– the first child with label <tt class="docutils literal">foo</tt> is picked with <tt class="docutils literal">foo[1]</tt>, and
the last can be picked with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">foo[last()]</span></tt>. Just <tt class="docutils literal">foo</tt> in a path picks
<em>all</em> the children with that label. This convention follows <a class="reference external" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath">XPath</a></dd>
<dt>What kind of data can be stored in the tree ?</dt>
<dd>Augeas only stores strings in the tree. So far, there hasn't been a
compelling reason to support other data types.</dd>
<dt>Where do a find the contents of a file ?</dt>
<dd>The contents of a file <tt class="docutils literal">/some/path</tt> are mapped into the tree as
<tt class="docutils literal">/files/some/path</tt>, which is usually a fine-grained tree view of that
file; additional (meta-)information about each file is available in
<tt class="docutils literal">/augeas/files/some/path</tt>.</dd>

<div class="section" id="describing-file-formats">
<h2>Describing file formats</h2>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>What are <em>lenses</em> ?</dt>
<dd><em>Lenses</em> are the building blocks of the file &lt;-&gt; tree transformation;
they combine parsing a file and building the tree, the <em>get</em>
transformation, with turning the tree back into an (updated) file, the
<em>put</em> transformation.</dd>
<dt>Why are they called <em>lenses</em> ?</dt>
<dd>The name comes from the <a class="reference external" href="http://alliance.seas.upenn.edu/~harmony/">Harmony project</a>. In Harmony's lingo, Augeas
maps back and forth between a <em>concrete view</em> (the configuration file) and
an <em>abstract view</em> (the tree representation). And calling something that
goes back and forth between two views a 'lens' seems only natural, doesn't
it ?</dd>
<dt>What is a <em>bidirectional language</em> ?</dt>
<dd>A bidirectional language is one where the program expresses a
transformation from input to output, and from (possibly modified) output
back to the corresponding input. They are called <em>bidirectional</em> rather
than <em>bijective</em> because there are generally many inputs for the same
output and vice versa. In Augeas case, many input files (e.g.,
<tt class="docutils literal">/etc/hosts</tt> with varying amounts of whitespace between fields) map to
the same tree, and there are many ways to map the same tree back to a
file. Other examples of bidirectional languages are <tt class="docutils literal">Harmony</tt> (mapping
trees to trees) and <tt class="docutils literal">Boomerang</tt> (mapping strings to strings), both from
the <a class="reference external" href="http://alliance.seas.upenn.edu/~harmony/">Harmony project</a>.</dd>
<dt>How is a file parsed ?</dt>
<dd>The <em>lenses</em> match regular expressions, different lenses do different
things with the strings that match (create a new tree node with a certain
label, store a value in a tree node, combine tree nodes into a larger
tree); writing the regular expressions is the main task when describing a
file format.</dd>
<dt>What is the regular expression syntax ?</dt>
<dd>Augeas uses <a class="reference external" href="http://www.regular-expressions.info/posix.html">extended POSIX regexps</a>. There are a few more esoteric
features of extended POSIX regexps that are not supported, the most
notable of them being POSIX named character classes, collating elements
and back references. Named character classes should be supported soon
(patches welcome).</dd>
<dt>What is the language in which file format descriptions are written ?</dt>
<dd>The file format descriptions are written in a small subset of ML (a
popular functional language.) If you don't know ML, don't despair: there
are only two or three constructs that you need to know to write file
format descriptions. The Augeas language is statically typed; besides the
'usual' checks of a type checker, checks also make sure that the
transformations described by lenses are safe.</dd>
<dt>How do I test my file format description ?</dt>
<dd>The Augeas language has a built-in <tt class="docutils literal">test</tt> construct for running unit
tests; additional round-trip tests can be found in the <tt class="docutils literal">tests/</tt>
directory in the source distribution. They are run by the <tt class="docutils literal">augtest</tt>
command in the same directory.</dd>
<dt>Where do I find existing file format descriptions ?</dt>
<dd>File format descriptions are contained in files with the extension
<tt class="docutils literal">.aug</tt>. In the source distribution, they are in the <tt class="docutils literal">lenses</tt>
directory, which, by default, is installed into
<tt class="docutils literal">/usr/share/augeas/lenses</tt>.</dd>
<dt>Can I send you my file format description ?</dt>
<dd>Yes, please. One of Augeas' goals is to collect file format descriptions,
and build a library of them, so that eventually there will be a
'canonical' tree representation of configuration data.</dd>

<div class="section" id="libfa-finita-automata">
<h2><tt class="docutils literal">libfa</tt> — Finita Automata</h2>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>What is <tt class="docutils literal">libfa</tt> ?</dt>
<dd><a class="reference external" href="libfa/">Libfa</a> is a library for manipulating finite automata. A finite automaton
is a representation of all strings matching a regular expression. Augeas
uses it for typechecking lenses and ensuring they don't contain
ambiguities.</dd>
<dt>Can I use <tt class="docutils literal">libfa</tt> outside of Augeas ?</dt>
<dd>Yes. <tt class="docutils literal">Libfa</tt> is also licensed under the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html">LGPL</a>, and has no dependencies
on Augeas.</dd>
<dt>What operations does <tt class="docutils literal">libfa</tt> support ?</dt>
<dd>A list of operations can be found <a class="reference external" href="libfa/operations.html">here</a>.</dd>
<dt>What regular expression syntax does <tt class="docutils literal">libfa</tt> support ?</dt>
<dd>It supports extended POSIX regular expressions, exactly the same as Augeas.</dd>
<dt>Why is there no operation to match a regular expression against a string ?</dt>
<dd>The GNU C library (and <a class="reference external" href="http://www.delorie.com/gnu/docs/regex/regex.html">GNU Regex</a>) contains a much better matcher than I
would ever hope to write for <tt class="docutils literal">libfa</tt> — being able to use that
matcher is the main reason for using extended POSIX syntax.</dd>
